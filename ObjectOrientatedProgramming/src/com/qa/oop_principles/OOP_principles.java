	// Within Java OOP (Object Orientated Programming) there are some key principles
	// These are things you should be doing for 'Best Practice' 
	
	// Abstraction - Only what MUST be visible to children / objects should be shown
	// Abstracting methods and variables and ONLY SHOWING the BARE MINIMUM 
	// Multiple abstract classes to give groups of functionality
	
	// Encapsulation - Data should be bundled together within itself, and should only be accessible in a limited fashion
	// nothing should have DIRECT ACCESS to data, but should use methods to get limited access to data
	
	// Inheritance - Data can be inherited (passed down) from its parent class using the EXTEND key word
	// Creating a class with some methods, another class EXTENDS from it adding new methods BUT using the original 
	
	// Polymorphism - What objects / fields does an object belong to
	// What objects are this object a child of, all objects can belong to multiple forms
